An express and graphql server for a project to simulate remote voting by delegates in a presidential nominating convention, inspired by current events (April 2020).

To start server:

`node server.js`

The server will start up a GraphiQL page at http://localhost:4000/graphql.

(Currently the server just displays the "Hello world!" message from the express-graphql tutorial.)
